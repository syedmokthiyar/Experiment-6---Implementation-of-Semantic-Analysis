# Experiment-6---Implementation-of-Semantic-Analysis

## Aim : Construct a python program to read a text from a file.Identify the verbs from the text file and provide synonyms for all verbs using Natutal Language Processing 

## ALGORITHM
1. Import the necessary libraries: `nltk` and `wordnet`.
2. Define a function `get_verbs(sentence)` to identify verbs in a given sentence using part-of-speech tagging.
3. Define a function `get_synonyms(word)` to get synonyms for a given word using the WordNet corpus.
4. Define a function `read_text_file(file_path)` to read text from a file and return the content as a string.
5. In the main program:
   - Set the `file_path` variable to the path of the input text file.
   - Read the text from the file using the `read_text_file()` function.
   - Tokenize the text into sentences using the `sent_tokenize()` function from the `nltk` library.
   - Initialize an empty list `all_verbs` to store all identified verbs.
   - Initialize an empty dictionary `synonyms_dict` to store the synonyms for each verb.
   - Iterate over each sentence:
     - Call the `get_verbs()` function to identify verbs in the sentence.
     - Append the identified verbs to the `all_verbs` list.
     - For each verb, call the `get_synonyms()` function to get its synonyms and store them in the `synonyms_dict` dictionary.
   - Print the verbs and their synonyms.
6. Execute the main program.
